# PROBLEM STATEMENT:
  Revolutionizing Voting with Faster and Secure AutomatedÂ Verification

# PROBLEM CREATOR'S ORGANISATION:
  Election Commission 

# SOLUTION:
  Secure and Efficient Automated Voting Solution:

Digital Identity: Biometric authentication (fingerprint, face) and Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) authenticate voter identity. Federated Identity Management can be investigated.

Secure Voting Platform: End-to-end encryption secures votes from casting to counting. Homomorphic encryption enables secure counting without decryption. A secure, distributed database stores encrypted votes with access controls and audit trails. Verifiable random sampling enables partial audits.

Automated Tallying: Machine-based vote counting offers speed and accuracy. Real-time auditing using secure logs and statistical analysis (with anonymity) is performed. Independent audits using statistical techniques and encrypted vote data (with controls) are enabled.

Accessibility: Support for multiple languages and assistive devices (screen reader, voice command) is available. Offline voting facilities are being considered.

Security: Strong security measures, such as access controls, intrusion detection, and regular audits, secure the central database.

Privacy: Privacy of the voters is ensured. Minimization of data collection and use of privacy-enhancing technologies are performed.

Scalability: Distributed database architecture and algorithms that have been optimized handle large numbers of votes.

Transparency: Independent audits, secure logs, and statistical analysis enable trust.

Implementation: Pilot experiments, stakeholder engagement, legality, security audits, and education are essential.

Challenges: Data security, scalability, trust in the central authority, privacy, cost, and the digital divide are met by strong measures and proper planning.
